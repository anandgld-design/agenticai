Currently, your predicted probability of approval is 0%, but there are some positive factors in your profile, such as your points and credit score. To improve your chances, I recommend increasing your points by at least 10. This adjustment could significantly enhance your likelihood of approval. \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]"
